    package.ps1 — assemble GritKeeper.zip for a GitHub Release.

    Run this AFTER you have signed the published exe. The zip must carry the SIGNED binary,
    so signing comes first; this script only assembles and compresses. It folds in the
    re-mirror step (per CLAUDE.md) so the source copy in the deliverable can never be skipped.

    The usual flow for a release:
        1.  cd GK\source; dotnet publish -c Release        # produces the self-contained exe
        2.  <your sign step>  (sign.ps1 / signtool with your .pfx)  on the published exe
        3.  .\package.ps1                                   # this script -> GritKeeper.zip
        4.  upload GritKeeper.zip to the GitHub Release, paste RELEASE_NOTES_v1.16.2.md

    -Exe   path to the (signed) published exe; defaults to the standard publish output.
    -Force package even if the exe is not Authenticode-signed (for a local test build only).
